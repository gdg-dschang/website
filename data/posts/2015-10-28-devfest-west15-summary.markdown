A BIG THANK to all the volunteers from different GDG groups of West Cameroon for their priceless help,  thanks to all the speakers for the great speeches and sharing their experience and knowledge.

The event took place on 28th of October at the [IUT of Bandjoun](https://www.facebook.com/IUT-FV-de-Bandjoun-167244506683516/). Devfest was focused on Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also Community Hub. Over 200 people participated in the event with a mix of students and working professionals (more 50% experienced developers).

**This two day was full of discoveries and records:**

* The first amount of visitors for the first west cameroon's devfest.
* 3 parallel tracks of Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also community hub.
* more than 10 sessions. No marketing - just technical hardcore!
* The widest geography of our speakers - Dschang, Bandjoun, Bangante, Foumban, Nkongsamba.
* Participating town : 5.
* The most useful 6 hours of workshops.

Moreover attendees were able to see how to build nice looking front-end application during workshops; and, of course, the last version Android Marshmallow!

As you could see, the most wonderful part was atmosphere - full of geeks, inventors, speakers, visitors, presenters and rocking the dancefloor at the afterparty :).

Thank you all!! You are awesome! Keep in touch with us!
